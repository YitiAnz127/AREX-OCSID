# Development

This document describes the standalone `@arex-skill/disco` package. The
runtime source lives in `packages/coding-agent/src`; there is no second wrapper
implementation and no runtime dependency on `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`.

## Setup

From the package root, which contains this file's parent `docs/` directory:

```bash
npm ci
npm run verify:provenance
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:examples
npm run build
```

Run the built CLI without installing it globally:

```bash
node dist/cli.js --help
node dist/cli.js
```

The caller's current working directory remains the DisCo project directory.
Use `DISCO_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to point development runs at a temporary config
directory when they must not use your normal `~/.disco/agent` state.

## Source layout

```text
packages/coding-agent/src/   runtime, CLI, SDK, modes, workflows, and TUI glue
packages/coding-agent/test/  upstream-derived and DisCo regression tests
docs/                        documentation shipped in the npm package
examples/                    extension, SDK, and RPC examples shipped in npm
scripts/                     build asset copying and package verification
dist/                        generated build output
```

`packages/coding-agent/upstream-package.json`, `UPSTREAM_SOURCE.md`,
`UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md`, and `UPSTREAM_MANIFEST.json` record the Pi v0.83.0
baseline. They are provenance inputs, not package roots and are not published.
The manifest records SHA-256 hashes and a disposition for every upstream file
and every local runtime, test, documentation, and example file.

## Build and package checks

```bash
npm run build
npm run verify:provenance
npm run verify:package
npm pack --dry-run --json
npm publish --dry-run
```

`verify:provenance` checks the local source inventory against the recorded
manifest. `verify:package` audits source, build output, documentation, and the
packed file contract. Release testing also installs the generated tarball into
a temporary npm prefix; it must not use a globally installed Pi package or a
source-tree symlink. The managed curl and PowerShell installers live at the
repository root and are attached to GitHub Releases separately from the npm
tarball.

When the pinned Pi baseline has not changed and a local DisCo source, test, docs,
or example file has intentionally changed, refresh only the local provenance:

```bash
npm run refresh:provenance -- --add-local docs/dynamic-workflows.md
```

`--add-local` may be repeated for intentional new files. The refresh command
updates local SHA-256 values and explicitly approved `disco_owned` additions; it
does not read an external Pi checkout or change upstream hashes and mappings.
Review the manifest diff before running the release gate. Unapproved files,
missing declared files, paths outside the inventoried roots, and path traversal
are errors.

## Running focused tests

Vitest paths are relative to the package root:

```bash
npx vitest --run --config vitest.config.ts packages/coding-agent/test/config.test.ts
npx vitest --run --config vitest.config.ts packages/coding-agent/test/resource-loader.test.ts
```

Tests that need real providers or a local proxy are separate from the default
deterministic suite. Proxy addresses belong in the test process environment or
a temporary settings fixture and must never become package defaults.

## Package assets

Runtime asset paths must be resolved through `src/config.ts`, not by assuming a
Pi monorepo layout. `scripts/copy-assets.mjs` copies bundled skills, themes, and
HTML export assets into `dist/`; npm's package file list includes README, docs,
examples, and notices directly from the package root.

Source-mode, built, packed, and globally installed runs must all resolve the
same DisCo package root and `.disco` configuration semantics.

## Debug log

The hidden `/debug` command writes `~/.disco/agent/disco-debug.log`. It can
contain rendered terminal output and recent model messages; inspect and share
it as potentially sensitive data.

## Upstream synchronization

For ordinary local DisCo work, do not use an external Pi checkout. Run
`npm run refresh:provenance -- --add-local <path>` after the local source change
is complete, then review `UPSTREAM_MANIFEST.json` and run
`npm run verify:provenance`.

When importing a later Pi coding-agent version:

1. Record the exact tag and commit in `packages/coding-agent/UPSTREAM_SOURCE.md`.
2. Regenerate `UPSTREAM_MANIFEST.json` with
   `node scripts/upstream-provenance.mjs --write --upstream-root /path/to/pi`
   and review every disposition change across source, tests, docs, examples,
   package assets, and the narrow OAuth exception.
3. Reapply DisCo ownership boundaries for `.disco`, `DISCO_*`, self-update,
   package discovery, Creator/Researcher filtering, SDK exports, and branding.
4. Run the complete deterministic, packed-install, coexistence, proxy, splash,
   and real-model regression gates before release.

The `--write --upstream-root <pi>` workflow is only for upstream migration or a
full upstream provenance audit. It is not a dependency of `npm run
verify:provenance`, `npm run prepublishOnly`, or the release script.

Do not copy upstream `node_modules`, `dist`, install locks, monorepo links, or
the Pi executable into the DisCo package.
