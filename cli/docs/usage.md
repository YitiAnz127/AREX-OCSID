# Using DisCo

This page collects day-to-day usage details that do not fit on the quickstart page.

## Interactive Mode

The interface has four main areas:

- **Startup header** - shortcuts, loaded context files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - user messages, assistant responses, tool calls, tool results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - where you type; border color indicates the current thinking level
- **Footer** - working directory, session name, token/cache usage, cost, context usage, and current model. Totals include assistant responses, usage reported by tools, and summary generation.

The editor can be replaced temporarily by built-in UI such as `/settings` or by custom extension UI.

### Editor Features

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Press Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line input | Shift+Enter, or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal |
| Copy response | Ctrl+X copies the last assistant message; in `/tree`, it copies the selected message |
| Images | Paste with Ctrl+V, Alt+V on Windows, or drag into the terminal |
| Shell command | `!command` runs and sends output to the model |
| Hidden shell command | `!!command` runs without sending output to the model |
| External editor | Ctrl+G opens `externalEditor`, `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, Notepad on Windows, or `nano` elsewhere |

See [Keybindings](keybindings.md) for all shortcuts and customization.

## Slash Commands

## Message Queue

You can submit messages while the agent is still working:

- **Enter** queues a steering message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls.
- **Alt+Enter** queues a follow-up message, delivered after the agent finishes all work.
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to the editor.
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to the editor.

On Windows Terminal, Alt+Enter is fullscreen by default. Remap it as described in [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) if you want disco to receive the shortcut.

Configure delivery in [Settings](settings.md) with `steeringMode` and `followUpMode`.

Background workflow execution has its own completion path: the workflow tool
returns a run ID and ends the current turn, then delivers the result back as a
follow-up when the run finishes. If another turn is active, the result waits
rather than interrupting it. See [Dynamic workflows](dynamic-workflows.md) for
run controls and recovery behavior.

## Sessions

Sessions are saved automatically to `~/.disco/agent/sessions/`, organized by working directory.

```bash
disco -c                  # Continue most recent session
disco -r                  # Browse and select a session
disco --no-session        # Ephemeral mode; do not save
disco --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
disco --session <path|id> # Use a specific session file or session ID
disco --fork <path|id>    # Fork a session into a new session file
```

Useful session commands:

- `/session` shows the current session file and ID.
- `/tree` navigates the in-file session tree and can summarize abandoned branches.
- `/fork` creates a new session from an earlier user message.
- `/clone` duplicates the current active branch into a new session file.
- `/compact` summarizes older messages to free context.

See [Sessions](sessions.md) and [Compaction](compaction.md) for details.

## Context Files

DisCo loads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` at startup from:

- `~/.disco/agent/AGENTS.md` for global instructions
- parent directories, walking up from the current working directory
- the current directory

Use context files for project conventions, commands, safety rules, and preferences. Disable loading with `--no-context-files` or `-nc`.

### System Prompt Files

Replace the default system prompt with:

- `.disco/SYSTEM.md` for a project
- `~/.disco/agent/SYSTEM.md` globally

Append to the default prompt without replacing it with `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` in either location.

### Project Trust

On interactive startup, disco asks before trusting a project folder that contains project-local settings, resources, or project `.agents/skills` and has no saved decision for the folder or a parent folder in `~/.disco/agent/trust.json`. Trusting a project allows disco to load `.disco/settings.json` and `.disco` resources, install missing project packages, and execute project extensions.

Before the trust decision, disco loads only context files, user/global extensions, and CLI `-e` extensions so they can handle the `project_trust` event. Project-local extensions, project package-managed extensions, and project settings are loaded only after the project is trusted. This split also applies when switching to a session from a different cwd whose trust has not been resolved in the current process.

Non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--mode json`, and `--mode rpc`) do not show a trust prompt. Without an applicable saved trust decision, they use `defaultProjectTrust` from global settings: `ask` (default) and `never` ignore those project resources, while `always` trusts them. Pass `--approve`/`-a` or `--no-approve`/`-na` to override project trust for one run.

If no extension or saved decision applies, `defaultProjectTrust` controls the fallback behavior. Set it to `"ask"`, `"always"`, or `"never"` in `~/.disco/agent/settings.json`, or change it with `/settings`.

`disco config` and package commands use the same project trust flow, except `disco update` never prompts. Pass `--approve` to trust project-local settings for one command or `--no-approve` to ignore them.

Use `/trust` in interactive mode to save a project trust decision for future sessions, including trust for the immediate parent folder. It writes `~/.disco/agent/trust.json` only; the current session is not reloaded, so restart disco for changes to take effect.


## Exporting and Sharing Sessions

Use `/export [file]` to write a session to HTML.

Use `/share` to upload a private GitHub gist with a shareable HTML link.

For upstream reference, Pi provides [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf) for publishing Pi sessions to Hugging Face datasets. It targets Pi session data and is not a supported DisCo session integration.

## CLI Reference

```bash
disco [options] [@files...] [messages...]
```

### Package Commands

```bash
disco install <source> [-l]     # Install package, -l for project-local
disco remove <source> [-l]      # Remove package
disco uninstall <source> [-l]   # Alias for remove
disco update [source|self|disco]   # Update disco only, or one package source
disco update --all              # Update disco and packages; reconcile pinned git refs
disco update --extensions       # Update packages only; reconcile pinned git refs
disco update --models           # Refresh model catalogs only
disco update --self             # Update disco only
disco update --extension <src>  # Update one package
disco list                      # List installed packages
disco config                    # Enable/disable package resources
```

These commands manage disco packages and `disco update` can update the disco CLI installation. To uninstall disco itself, see [Quickstart](quickstart.md#uninstall). `disco config` and project package commands accept `--approve`/`--no-approve` to trust or ignore project-local settings for one command. `disco update` never prompts for project trust.

See [DisCo Packages](packages.md) for package sources and security notes.

### Agent Modes

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--creator` | Start a new session with Creator resources and workflow boundaries |
| `--researcher` | Start a new session with Researcher resources and workflow boundaries |
| `--agent-mode <mode>` | Compatibility form for `creator` or `researcher` |

These selectors choose the Agent role and work with both interactive startup and
non-interactive output. They are independent of `-p` / `--print` and
`--mode text|json|rpc`.

### Modes

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| default | Interactive mode |
| `-p`, `--print` | Print response and exit |
| `--mode json` | Output all events as JSON lines; see [JSON mode](json.md) |
| `--mode rpc` | RPC mode over stdin/stdout; see [RPC mode](rpc.md) |
| `--export <in> [out]` | Export a session to HTML |

In print mode, disco also reads piped stdin and merges it into the initial prompt:

```bash
cat README.md | disco -p "Summarize this text"
```

### Model Options

| Option | Description |

### File Arguments

Prefix files with `@` to include them in the message:

```bash
disco @prompt.md "Answer this"
disco -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"
disco @code.ts @test.ts "Review these files"
```

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive with initial prompt
disco "List all .ts files in src/"

# Non-interactive
disco -p "Summarize this codebase"

# Non-interactive with piped stdin
cat README.md | disco -p "Summarize this text"

# Named one-shot session
disco --name "release audit" -p "Audit this repository"

# Different model

disco --model openai/gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with thinking level shorthand
disco --model sonnet:high "Solve this complex problem"

# Limit model cycling
disco --models "claude-*,gpt-4o"

# Read-only mode
disco --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "Review the code"

# Disable one extension or built-in tool while keeping the rest available
disco --exclude-tools ask_question
```

## Design Principles

DisCo keeps the core small and pushes most task-specific behavior into
extensions, skills, prompt templates, and packages.

It intentionally does not include built-in MCP, permission popups, plan mode,
to-dos, or background bash. The minimal coding-tool set also does not expose a
general manual subagent command; coordinated subagents are managed by the
built-in [dynamic workflow runtime](dynamic-workflows.md). Other workflows can
be built or installed as extensions or packages, or run through external tools
such as containers and tmux.

For the full rationale, read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-disco-coding-agent/).
