# Extend Repo Skill

## Purpose

Use this skill when the user already has a generated or hand-written Agent Skill and wants to expand it without losing the useful behavior it already provides.

Typical requests include:

- Add support for a new repo feature, public API, CLI, workflow, model family, config format, or troubleshooting path that the user specifically wants covered.
- Improve thin references, missing scripts, poor routing, incomplete usability tests, or unclear triggering.
- Extend an existing skill for a larger repo instead of regenerating it from scratch.

If the user's main concern is that the repository code, docs, APIs, CLIs,
configs, or dependencies changed and the old skill may be stale, use the sibling
`refresh-repo-skill` skill instead.

The expected result is an edited runtime skill directory plus updated
usability test cases and a verification/human-review package under the
skill's review/test artifact directory. Do not create a separate replacement
skill unless the user explicitly asks for a fork.

## Inputs

Gather or infer:

- Existing skill directory containing `SKILL.md`.
- Resolved DisCo agent directory, normally `~/.disco/agent` or the active
  `DISCO_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, when the existing skill may be a live managed copy.
- Repository path used as the evidence source for the extension.
- The user's requested new capability, failure mode, coverage gap, or quality improvement.
- Python inspection environment and installed package name when live API verification is needed.
- Existing review/test artifact directory, if any.
- Desired review/test artifact output directory, if the user has a preference.

If the existing skill directory is missing or does not contain `SKILL.md`, stop and ask for the correct skill path.

## Reference Map

Read these references as the workflow reaches each stage:

- [references/extension-planning.md](references/extension-planning.md): scope capture, current-skill audit, repository evidence gathering, coverage-gap planning, and extension plan format.
- [references/editing-and-versioning.md](references/editing-and-versioning.md): editing rules, preserving existing behavior, frontmatter constraints, references/scripts updates, and usability-case expansion.
- [references/verification-and-handoff.md](references/verification-and-handoff.md): automatic verification, human review package, regression-sensitive checks, and final handoff.
- [../verify-repo-skill/scripts/resolve_repo_license.mjs](../verify-repo-skill/scripts/resolve_repo_license.mjs)
  and [../verify-repo-skill/scripts/apply_repo_license.mjs](../verify-repo-skill/scripts/apply_repo_license.mjs):
  resolve and recursively apply the source repository license for the exact
  extension commit before verification.

When useful, also read sibling workflow-skill references: `../create-repo-skill/references/` for canonical skill IDs, repository evidence discovery, installed-package inspection, planning, and writing, and `../verify-repo-skill/references/` for usability test-case format, verification review, and import/index routing guidance.

## Required Workflow

1. Resolve the existing skill directory, repository path, requested extension,
   DisCo agent directory, and review/test artifact directory. If the user does
   not specify an artifact directory, default to
   `<repository-path>/skills/tests/<skill-id>/`, with usability cases under
   `test-cases/` and review reports under `reports/`. If the existing skill is
   the live managed copy under
   `<agent-dir>/skills/repositories/repo-skills/<skill-id>/`, copy only its runtime tree to a
   working directory outside `<agent-dir>/skills/`, preserving the
   `<skill-id>` directory basename. Keep that working copy until the dedicated
   importer succeeds; never edit the live managed copy in place.
2. Read [references/extension-planning.md](references/extension-planning.md). Audit current root/sub-skill routing, bundled references, bundled scripts, evals, usability tests, and known gaps before editing.
3. Gather targeted repository evidence for the requested extension. Use source code plus installed-package inspection for API facts; use docs, examples, tests, and configs for intent and workflows.
4. Write a concise extension plan that maps each new or changed capability to exactly one skill location, reference, script, or usability case.
5. Read [references/editing-and-versioning.md](references/editing-and-versioning.md). Edit the resolved source or external working copy while preserving useful current guidance, frontmatter IDs, and public structure. Preserve the canonical `repo_id` and `skill_id` unless the user explicitly requests an identity migration. Treat the current area-family assignments as the baseline. If the extension is only deeper coverage of already routed capabilities, retain those assignments. If it adds a distinct capability, removes a capability, changes the repository's scope, changes the taxonomy hash, or the user requests reclassification, create a new external area-family routing handoff with assignment-specific evidence and update the minimal v2 metadata to match it. Never hand-edit generated family pages or silently change routing in the skill prose.
6. Resolve and apply the repository license after the extension source commit
   is known and before verification:

   ```bash
   node ../verify-repo-skill/scripts/resolve_repo_license.mjs \
     --repository <owner/repository> \
     --source-commit <40-hex-source-commit> \
     --json > <artifact-root>/reports/license-resolution.json
   node ../verify-repo-skill/scripts/apply_repo_license.mjs \
     --skill-dir <external-runtime-skill-dir> \
     --license <value-from-report>
   ```

   Re-query on every extension and synchronize the one returned value over the
   complete root/sub-skill tree. Record old value, new value, source commit,
   status, and reason in the handoff. Preserve `NOASSERTION` as the accepted
   source value and use `NO_LICENSE` only when the resolver is unavailable; this
   fallback is a warning, not a legal conclusion, and does not by itself block
   verification or import.
7. Add or update usability test cases for the new capability and at least one regression-sensitive existing workflow under `test-cases/` in the review/test artifact directory.
8. Read [references/verification-and-handoff.md](references/verification-and-handoff.md). Run automatic verification, create a human review package under `reports/` in the review/test artifact directory, and fix blocking issues.
9. After verification passes, follow `verify-repo-skill`'s structured import
   policy. Ask for import or overwrite approval unless the user already
   authorized that exact action, then run
   `verify-repo-skill/scripts/import_repo_skill.mjs` with the verified external
   runtime directory and `--routing-entry
   <repo-path>/skills/disco/routing_decision/classification.json`. The external
   handoff is mandatory for a normal classified import, even when the existing
   area-family assignments are retained. Pass `--overwrite` only for the exact
   approved existing managed skill. The importer installs the runtime tree and
   rebuilds the sibling live `repo-skills-router` under one rollback-capable
   global lock.
   After success, DisCo Researcher can use the extended skill in a new session;
   use `import-repo-skills-to-agent` only for an explicitly requested
   cross-agent export.

## Non-Negotiables

- Do not discard and rewrite the whole skill just because the extension is easier to express from scratch.
- Do not edit a live skill under `<agent-dir>/skills/repositories/repo-skills/` directly.
  Extend an external working copy, then let
  `verify-repo-skill/scripts/import_repo_skill.mjs` replace the approved live
  target.
- Do not install an extended repo skill through a manually assembled copy and
  router-update sequence.
- Do not rename root or sub-skill IDs unless the user explicitly asks or the current names are invalid.
- Do not silently change a repository's `repo_id` or `skill_id`; identity
  changes are separate migrations that must update the central repository
  index and all router references together.
- Do not silently change area-family assignments. Preserve them for a
  same-scope extension, and use the verified routing handoff plus the locked
  importer when the extension changes capability scope or requires
  reclassification.
- Do not remove existing references, scripts, routes, or usability cases unless they are wrong, stale, duplicated, or replaced by a better self-contained artifact.
- Do not add claims about APIs, CLIs, configs, data formats, or runtime behavior without repository evidence or live inspection.
- Do not leak local checkout paths, Python executable paths, virtualenv or conda names, `pip show` locations, or machine-specific details into public skill files.
- Do not link runtime skill documentation to original repo docs, examples, notebooks, or scripts. Distill or adapt material into the skill directory.
- Do not leave new or existing runtime guidance that tells future agents to run,
  read, or adapt source repo scripts by path. Bundle the needed script,
  wrapper, or distilled recipe inside the skill's own `scripts/` or
  `references/` tree before linking it.
- Do not treat `tests/` as a skill directory. It is the review/test artifact area.
- Do not write `evals/`, verification reports, human-review notes, publication checklists, prompt samples, benchmark notes, or other check-only artifacts inside the runtime skill directory. Put concrete usability cases under the review/test artifact directory's `test-cases/` subtree and reports under its `reports/` subtree, defaulting to `<repository-path>/skills/tests/<skill-id>/`.

## Output Summary

By the end, the user should have:

- The source skill directory or external working copy updated without mutating a
  live managed skill outside the import transaction.
- New or revised references/scripts/sub-skills where the requested capability needs depth.
- Updated usability test cases in the configured review/test artifact directory's `test-cases/` subtree.
- An automatic verification report and human review package in the configured review/test artifact directory's `reports/` subtree.
- An approved managed import that DisCo Researcher can use directly in a new
  session, or a clear staged-only status when import was declined.
- A routing handoff that records whether the existing assignments were
  preserved or reclassified, including evidence for any changed assignment.
- A final handoff that distinguishes changed public skill content, review/test
  artifacts, evidence used, import status, and remaining gaps.
