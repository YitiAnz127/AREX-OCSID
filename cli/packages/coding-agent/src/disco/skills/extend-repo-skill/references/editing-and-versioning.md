# Editing and Versioning

## Purpose

Read this while editing the existing skill. Keep the update narrow, self-contained, and compatible with the current skill structure.

## Preserve Stable Identity

Keep existing root and sub-skill directory names and frontmatter `name` values unless the user explicitly requested a rename or the current values violate the skill-id rules.

Every `SKILL.md` frontmatter block must remain valid:

```markdown
---
name: skill-id
description: "Triggering description broad enough for natural user requests."
disable-model-invocation: true
license: <repository-license-or-NO_LICENSE>
metadata:
  disco-role: operating
---
```

Preserve or add `disable-model-invocation: true` on repo root and sub-skill
frontmatter so imported repo skills stay behind `repo-skills-router` in
compatible agents. Do not add it to `repo-skills-router` itself; Codex target
visibility is handled during `import-repo-skills-to-agent`.
Preserve or add `metadata.disco-role: operating` on the same files so they are
available in Researcher mode and excluded from Creator mode.

## Extension License Metadata

Resolve the source repository license again for the exact source commit used by
the extension. Use the shared resolver and apply the result to the complete
external runtime tree before verification:

```bash
node ../verify-repo-skill/scripts/resolve_repo_license.mjs \
  --repository <owner/repository> \
  --source-commit <40-hex-source-commit> \
  --json > <artifact-root>/reports/license-resolution.json
node ../verify-repo-skill/scripts/apply_repo_license.mjs \
  --skill-dir <external-runtime-skill-dir> \
  --license <value-from-report>
```

Do not let individual subagents choose license values. Use one repository-level
value in every root/sub-skill frontmatter. Preserve `NOASSERTION` results; use
`NO_LICENSE` only for unavailable results; record old value, new value, source
commit, status, and reason for the handoff. `NO_LICENSE` is a warning about
query availability, not a legal conclusion.

## Edit The Working Runtime Tree

Edit in place only when the resolved tree is a source directory outside the live
DisCo skills root. If the starting point was
`<agent-dir>/skills/repositories/repo-skills/<skill-id>/`, edit its external working copy and
leave the live tree unchanged until the dedicated importer replaces it under the
global lock.

Prefer these edit actions, in order:

1. Add a route or decision point to the nearest existing `SKILL.md`.
2. Extend the nearest existing reference file when it already owns the topic.
3. Add a new focused reference when the topic is substantial enough to need its own file.
4. Add a safe reusable script when the workflow benefits from deterministic checks, inspection, conversion, validation, or smoke testing.
5. Add a new sub-skill only when the requested capability has distinct triggers, workflows, references, or scripts that would overload existing sub-skills.

Avoid broad rewrites, unrelated style churn, and moving content only for aesthetics.

## Maintain Self-Containment

Any instruction that would make a future agent open the original repo should be replaced with bundled content:

- Distill docs into `references/*.md`.
- Adapt safe examples into `scripts/`.
- Copy small schemas or config templates only when they are needed and public.
- Summarize large notebooks or training scripts into reproducible recipes.

When a source repo script is unsafe, too large, or environment-specific, extract the reusable logic into a smaller skill script or describe the necessary steps in a reference.

For every source repo script, example, notebook, tool, or config that the
extended skill tells future agents to run, read, or adapt, add or update one
skill-owned replacement and link that replacement from the nearest `SKILL.md`.
Do not use Markdown links that point outside the runtime skill directory, such
as `../scripts/foo.py`, `../../examples/bar.py`, or an absolute checkout path.

## Update Usability Tests

For each meaningful extension:

- Add at least one new case that targets the new capability.
- Add or update at least one regression-sensitive case for an existing capability that could be affected by the edit.
- Keep `user_request.txt` directly copyable with no labels, headings, or test metadata.
- Update `index.md` so the case set reflects the new coverage.

If the skill has no existing test-case directory, create one under the
review/test artifact directory using the same shape required by
`create-repo-skill`.

## Version Notes

When useful, add a short extension note outside runtime skill docs, such as in
the final handoff or the review package under the review/test artifact
directory:

- Changed files.
- Added capabilities.
- Removed stale guidance, if any.
- New or updated usability cases.
- Verification status.

Do not put development history inside `SKILL.md` unless it directly helps future agents choose correct behavior.
